        <h2>How to Join IB2 Theft Prevention System</h2>
        <p>
            Joining the IB2 community is unique because it involves a commitment not just to securing your own bicycle but also to the broader cycling community.
            Our membership is currently based on an invite-only system to ensure each member genuinely upholds and promotes our core values and security standards.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Invitation Process</strong></p>
        <p>Membership invitations at IB2 are extended on a cyclist-to-cyclist basis. This method ensures that all new members are familiar with our community's expectations and are committed to active participation. Existing members can invite new cyclists whom they trust and who have demonstrated a sincere dedication to bicycle security.</p>

        <p><strong>Commitment Level</strong></p>
        <p>Being a part of IB2 requires a high level of commitment. Each member is expected to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Actively engage in community activities and initiatives.</li>
            <li>Maintain the integrity and security of their own and fellow cyclists' bicycles.</li>
            <li>Participate in community-led security programs and workshops.</li>
            <li>Spread awareness about bicycle security and encourage responsible cycling practices within their local community.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Why an Invite-Only System?</strong></p>
        <p>This exclusive approach helps us maintain a trustworthy and committed community, where members actively contribute to each other's safety and to the cycling community as a whole. It ensures that every new member aligns with our mission of redefining bicycle security and is willing to actively support and participate in our collective security initiatives.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in joining and know a current IB2 member, we encourage you to reach out to them for more information about obtaining an invitation. For those who do not yet know a member, consider connecting with our community at events and online forums to demonstrate your interest and commitment. Although membership is exclusive, our community is always eager to welcome dedicated new members who share our passion for cycling security.</p>
